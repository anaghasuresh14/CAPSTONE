With the rise in complexity of the job roles of today’s parents and their hectic
schedules, the need for infants to be observed frequently when left in the care of a
caretaker to avoid any kind of injury and to constantly have an eye upon them all
day becomes a tedious task. In today’s world, small infants and children being
subjected to abuse from caretakers and others has become a serious issue, due to
which parents are unable to entrust them with the safety of their child.
We seek to provide a novel approach for infant monitoring that sends alerts to
parents with respect to few cases of prospectively dangerous situations that an
infant might be exposed to.To implement this a framework has been built.It
consists of two phases. The first phase consists of the models for infant activity
detection, harmful object detection and stranger detection. The second phase
consists of the mobile application through which parents receive alerts if the infant
is exposed to danger.
This would avoid the need for constant monitoring of the infant from the parent’s
side as the monitoring would mainly be required only when an alert has been
issued indicating the occurrence of an abnormal situation.
